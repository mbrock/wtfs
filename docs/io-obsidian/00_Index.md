# Zig IO Atlas

- [[Exploring Zig IO Interfaces]] — long-form narrative weaving buffering, stateful interfaces, and comparisons.
- [[Andrew Kelley Talk Commentary]] — annotated companion to the "Don't Forget to Flush" talk.
- [[Buffer Scheduling]] — on buffers as micro-schedulers of bytes.
- [[Stateful Interface Ontology]] — semantically unpacking Zig's interface structs.
- [[Comparative Interface Patterns]] — contrast with Rust, Go, C++ streambuf, JavaScript Streams.
- [[HTTP BodyWriter Case Study]] — how vtable policies drive HTTP transfer encodings.
- [[Tar Writer Case Study]] — archival rituals on the same interface core.
- [[Hashed Writer Pattern]] — side-channel transformations while streaming.

## Starting Points

- Existing outline: [[Exploring Zig IO Interfaces#Outline Snapshot]]
- Original transcript snippets: [[Andrew Kelley Talk Commentary#Transcript Anchors]]

## Backlog

- Async runtime implications
- Reader-side limited/peek patterns
- More real-world case studies (zstd, logging)
